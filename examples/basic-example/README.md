<h1 align="center">Stashy: Basic Example</h1>

This is a simple TypeScript project using NextJS and Expo to show how to save and retrieve data from Stashy in the browser, React Native, and NextJS server side.

## Usage

First things first, install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

To run this example on the web:

```bash
yarn start:next
```

To run this example on native:

```bash
yarn start:expo
```

You can run both `start:next` and `start:expo` at the same time.

Main usage is in `pages/index.tsx`. You can see how to use Stashy in the browser, React Native, and NextJS server side.
